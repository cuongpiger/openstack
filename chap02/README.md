# Chapter 02. Taking an OpenStack test-drive
* To interact with OpenStack, you use DevStack
* DevStack helps you to deploy a single-node OpenStack cloud without knowing a great deal about OpenStack and without the need for a bunch of hardware.


## 2.1. What is DevStack
* DevStack was created to make the job of deploying OpenStack in **test** and **development** environment quicker, easier.
* DevStack is a collection of documented Bash shell scripts that are used to prepare an environment for configure, and deploy OpenStack.
* But DevStack is not used to deploy an OpenStack production environment.
